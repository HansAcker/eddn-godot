EDDN in Godot
=============

My first [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) experiment.

Connects to a [websocket server](https://eddn-realtime.space/) and
plots [EDDN](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN) events in the galaxy.

Coding styles and spelling still WIP.

Sprites and galaxy plane from the [Canonn Map](https://map.canonn.tech/).

Camera movement with joystick axes or WASD/RF/QE/YC.
Home to get home. Del to remove all stars.
Backspace to reconnect the websocket.
