EDDN in Godot
=============

My first [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) experiment.

Connects to a [websocket server](https://eddn-realtime.space/) and
plots [EDDN](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN) events in the galaxy.

For now, it just idly spins the camera with no control on an unfinished
galaxy, uses huge amounts of memory since the last iteration and randomly
stops receiving websocket events.

Sprites and galaxy plane from the [Canonn Map](https://map.canonn.tech/).
